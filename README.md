# operational_analysis
This project involves building and evaluating a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images into four different categories. The complete workflow includes data loading, preprocessing, model building, training with callbacks, and evaluation on a test set.

## ðŸš€ Project Highlights
- Built a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras.
- Used ImageDataGenerator for efficient image loading and augmentation.
- Implemented EarlyStopping and ModelCheckpoint to improve training.
- Achieved strong evaluation results on a separate test dataset.
